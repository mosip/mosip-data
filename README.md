# Sample Data

## Overview
This repo contains data that is uploaded into MOSIP during [sandbox installation](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/deployment/sandbox-deployment). The data needs to be reviewed and modified for a country specific deployment. Refer to [Masterdata Guide](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/deployment/masterdata-guide). 

## For Build and Run
Data initialization is performed through the **Master Data Loader** as part of the [postgres-init](https://github.com/mosip/postgres-init/tree/release-1.3.x) repository.
